# Scoring Weights for the Yield-Risk Engine
# These must add up to 1.0 (100%)

weights:
  # Priority 1: Cash Flow (Rent-to-Cost Ratio)
  rent_to_cost: 0.40
  
  # Priority 2: Safety (Low Maintenance Risk)
  # Note: Since high risk score is bad, we will invert this in the code
  maintenance_risk: 0.40
  
  # Priority 3: Vacancy/Market Health (Adjusted Revenue)
  vacancy_adjusted: 0.20

scaling:
  # We use these to normalize the data (0 to 1 scale)
  # Based on typical Kokomo market values
  max_risk_score: 200  # Anything above 200 is "0 points" for safety
  target_yield: 0.015  # 1.5% is "100 points" for yield
